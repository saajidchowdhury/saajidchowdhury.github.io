My name is Saajid. I like physics, math, logic, computer algorithms, improvising music on the cello, solving puzzles, and making things perfect. I am a second year undergraduate student and member of the Honors College at Stony Brook University, majoring in physics and pure mathematics, and may declare a minor in applied mathematics. I competed as a team member of the SBU-NON-CS-MAJORS in the 2021 ICPC Greater NY Regional algorithmic programming contest, where we placed in the top half of teams consisting of mostly CS majors ([more info](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~compprog/20210413.html)). I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i67cFjaJRg) in which I derived Gauss's Law from Coulomb's Law and then proved that Gauss's Law works in general. I do particle detector simulation research with [Stony Brook's EIC group](https://www.stonybrook.edu/cfns/).
